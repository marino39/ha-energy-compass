# Source requirements and selection

During setup or later through **Configure** or **Reconfigure**, open **Tariffs → Buy source** and **Tariffs → Sell source** independently. Choose **fixed** for the rate in **Tariffs → Fixed rates and transformations**, **entity** for a current numeric state or attribute, or **forecast** for structured interval data. The source entity, attribute and mapping screens show the saved selection when editing. Opening them does not change the saved configuration; Preview validates current data and the base plan before the final confirmation.

Use **Sources → Review and edit sources** to identify one existing binding, then edit it, append a today/tomorrow continuation, or confirm removal. The inventory identifies each PV group and continuation separately and keeps unavailable or older unsupported selections visible for repair. **Sources → Add source** chooses a role and compatible mode. To add a separate PV array, choose the next group number; a continuation in an existing group extends that group's forecast. Removing a PV group is a separate explicit action. Required buy, sell, load and battery SOC selections need a replacement or the related component disabled before removal. A tariff group name such as `G12` is not a price and does not define a schedule.

| Source | Selected data | Required shape | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current price | State of a sensor, number or input_number | Finite number | Held constant over the planning horizon; read again on recalculation |
| Current price attribute | Named attribute of an available numeric-source entity | Finite number | Same constant-horizon assumption |
| Price forecast | Attribute of an available entity | List of records, or a timestamp-to-price map | Future changes follow the supplied intervals |

Use the installation currency, for example `PLN/kWh` or `PLN/MWh`. MWh prices convert to kWh once by dividing by 1000. No exchange conversion is performed. For a state value, existing `unit_of_measurement` must match the declared source unit; attribute values require an explicit unit declaration. Zero and negative prices are allowed within configured bounds; they are not automatically clipped.

Every selected source must exist and its parent entity must not be `unknown` or `unavailable`. Numeric strings such as `0.75` are accepted; names, blank values, NaN and infinity are not prices. An attribute cannot rescue an unavailable parent state.

## Numeric examples

Entity state: `sensor.import_price`, state `0.75`, `unit_of_measurement: PLN/kWh` → 0.75 PLN/kWh for the whole planning horizon.

Entity attribute: `sensor.market_price`, available parent state, numeric attribute `import_price: 750`, declared unit `PLN/MWh` → 0.75 PLN/kWh. Select the attribute explicitly; the parent's unit may describe another value.

A current cheap-zone rate does not reveal when the next expensive zone starts. Use an interval forecast when time-of-use changes matter.

## Forecast example

Illustrative attributes; substitute current timestamps and actual provider fields:

```yaml
prices:
  - start: '2026-09-18T10:00:00+02:00'
    end: '2026-09-18T11:00:00+02:00'
    price: 0.75
  - start: '2026-09-18T11:00:00+02:00'
    end: '2026-09-18T12:00:00+02:00'
    price: 0.90
```

Select attribute `prices`, value path `price`, start path `start`, end path `end`, and unit `PLN/kWh`. When the end is absent, configure an explicit duration field or interval length. A timestamp-to-number map can also supply start times and prices with a configured interval length. HA entity state is a string; JSON text in that state is not automatically parsed into a forecast.

Records require positive duration and finite prices. Prefer ISO 8601 timestamps with `Z` or an explicit UTC offset. Naive local timestamps need a configured source timezone; ambiguous/nonexistent daylight-saving timestamps are rejected. Nested fields use dot-separated paths, for example `tariff.amount`; expressions, list indexes and templates are not supported in mapping fields.

Today/tomorrow entities are continuations of one price series, not values to add. For example, select `sensor.price_today` with attribute `prices`, then use **Sources → Review and edit sources → Buy continuation → Append continuation** to select `sensor.price_tomorrow` with the same mapping. Exact duplicate intervals with the same price deduplicate; contradictory or partially overlapping intervals fail. Coverage begins at the calculation time. Missing tomorrow shortens known coverage and produces quality information, rather than inventing a future rate.

## Age and transformations

Age checks use Home Assistant `last_updated`, which changes when the state or attributes change. A configured forecast publication path adds a publication-age check. A deliberately stable manual helper may disable age checking explicitly; unavailable data still fail. Set limits to match the provider's publication schedule.

After unit normalization, the effective rate is `price × multiplier × VAT factor + addition`, where the VAT factor is `1 + VAT percent / 100` when enabled. Avoid applying charges or VAT twice if the entity already provides the final rate. Check the resolved values in Preview before saving.

## Daily battery throughput

Select **Sources → Add source → throughput_today → measurement** before setting a positive daily cycle limit in **Battery**. Use a numeric entity or attribute containing total AC-side charge plus discharge energy since midnight in the installation timezone. It must reset daily, stay nonnegative and update after midnight. Use kWh or Wh; Wh convert once to kWh. This is not instantaneous power, SOC, net energy, grid import or a lifetime counter.

The selected entity must be available, within the chosen age limit, and have `last_updated` dated today in the installation timezone. External recorder statistics are not supported as the input to this constraint. A legacy unsupported binding remains visible for replacement; it is not silently converted.

Daily cap: `2 × battery capacity kWh × daily_cycles`. Remaining today: `max(0, daily cap − measured throughput)`. Preview shows the selected entity/attribute, resolved throughput, cap and remaining today. A cycle limit of zero disables this constraint, and a battery-disabled installation does not require this source.

The existing optimizer budgets charge plus discharge on its AC-side flow basis; it accounts for SOC efficiency separately. A DC counter needs an upstream conversion that accounts for charging and discharging losses before selection here. Energy Compass does not infer or apply that conversion.
