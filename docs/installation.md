# Install and display Energy Compass

Energy Compass is an advisory custom integration for Home Assistant 2026.9.1 or later. In HACS, add `https://github.com/marino39/ha-energy-compass` under **Custom repositories** as an **Integration**, download it, and restart Home Assistant. Alternatively, copy this repository's `custom_components/energy_compass` directory into the Home Assistant config directory's `custom_components` folder, then restart. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Energy Compass**. Choose a name, currency, and timezone, then configure the required buy tariff and household load. Presets are editable starting points; generic sources can select entities and nested attributes through the flow. [Source requirements and examples](source-requirements.md) explain numeric states, attributes, forecast records, age limits and battery throughput. Preview the normalized inputs, coverage, units, ages, and assumptions before saving. Optional PV and battery sources can be added when available. Open **Configure** on the integration to change horizons, presentation, and notification preferences later.

On first setup, Preview separately asks you to acknowledge the displayed buy source and household load source, then confirm the final save. This includes an unchanged fixed buy rate of zero, which intentionally means free import, and the default 10 kWh/day household estimate. The resolved rate, helper, tariff transformation, load method, and estimate or fallback amount are shown before confirmation. Returning to edit a draft clears these acknowledgements. Existing installations retain their original final confirmation when using Configure or Reconfigure.

Preview checks source inputs and solves a bounded base plan before any save. It shows separate source, base-plan, and extra-consumption-guidance statuses. An infeasible or timed-out base plan cannot be saved; the preview shows the applicable limits or a retry suggestion. A feasible base plan may be saved even if adding extra household consumption would later prove impossible. Extra-consumption guidance is calculated after saving and is not validated by Preview.

Changing an existing installation’s currency opens **Review amounts in the new currency** before preview or save. Review fixed buy/sell rates, tariff additions, battery wear, absolute consumption thresholds, terminal energy value, and the monthly charge, then explicitly confirm the amounts in the selected currency. No exchange conversion occurs. Helpers and forecast price sources must also use the selected currency; update their bindings before saving. Another currency change requires another review.

For a disposable synthetic setup with no provider entities, choose name **Synthetic**, currency **EUR**, timezone **UTC**, preset **Generic**, with PV and battery off. In **Tariffs → Fixed rates and transformations**, enter an explicit fixed buy rate (for example, 0.30 EUR/kWh) and sell rate (for example, 0 EUR/kWh). In **Forecast**, set the daily household estimate to 10 kWh; in **Hardware**, set grid import to a finite value such as 10 kW. The generic setup already uses fixed buy and sell rates and a daily load estimate, so open **Preview** to inspect the generated intervals and assumptions, acknowledge the buy and load inputs separately, then confirm. Forecast updates and future windows require interval sources with adequate coverage.

For a synthetic interval source, an entity can expose a `rows` attribute with records such as `{from: ISO timestamp, to: ISO timestamp, tariff: {amount: 0.2}}`. Select **Tariffs → Buy source → forecast**, choose the entity and `rows` attribute, map start `from`, end `to`, and value `tariff.amount`, and declare EUR/kWh. The example contains no household data. Real installations should select their own entities, units, timestamps, and age limits, and check the preview before saving.

The integration creates one device and native sensors for the current household level and extra-kWh cost, the optimized machine state and costs, the next different level, three upcoming window starts, the plan, and optimizer status. A forecast-valid binary sensor reports plan availability, coverage, and current-guidance validity. The diagnostic Alert binary sensor reports input or calculation failures separately; its reason and timestamp remain available while the last covered plan continues with `plan_retained: true`. If the current household probe is infeasible but the baseline forecast is valid, the current household level/cost may be unavailable while known later windows remain usable. Entity IDs can be renamed; select entities by name in the UI rather than assuming an ID.

A `select.<name>_strategy` entity picks the dispatch strategy the optimizer solves (`cost_min`, `self_sufficiency`, `backup_ready`, `pv_swap`, `max_export`, `grid_friendly`); it always reflects the saved configuration, even while a plan is mid-recalculation. See [dispatch strategies](model.md#dispatch-strategies) for what each bundle changes.

For battery SOC and optional BMS SOC, the default timestamp policy is `auto` with the native `last_reported` path. On older saved native `last_updated` paths without a policy, `auto` also uses Home Assistant's `last_reported` when available, so an identical fresh reading remains fresh. If that native field is absent in an older snapshot, it uses `last_updated`. A custom path such as `attributes.reported_at` always means that exact measurement timestamp. Select `exact_path` to require the chosen field literally, including `last_updated` when only a changed reading should count. Stale, invalid, or future timestamps are rejected, and explicit custom paths are retained during migration.

The Plan sensor and Forecast valid binary sensor expose `load_quality`. Its `source_mode` names the selected recorder, daily estimate, or supplied forecast source; `method` reports history, history with fallback, fallback, daily estimate, or forecast. `coverage` lists the actual time segments, method, and eligible historical samples available/required for recorder buckets. `fallback_coverage_hours` and `fallback_fraction` measure elapsed UTC forecast time, not energy share or a count of slots. Repeated daylight-saving hours remain distinct. A recorder fallback adds the `load_history_fallback` warning even if estimated fallback energy is zero. A chosen daily estimate or supplied forecast does not imply missing recorder history. This detailed quality attribute is excluded from recorder state history because it changes with each forecast.

## Native dashboard, using the visual editor

Create a **Sections** view or add cards to an existing view. Add a **Tile** card and select **Consumption compass** for the prominent current level. Add an **Entities** card and use its entity picker to add **Next change**, **Next BOOST start**, **Next CHEAP start**, and **Next LIMIT start**. Include **Forecast valid**, **Optimizer status**, and **Alert** in a second card. Each timestamp row shows a local start time. For each window row, open **Edit → Secondary information → Add** and select the **End** attribute to show its end beside the start. An unavailable window means there is no matching window in known coverage: inspect **Plan** → `window_status` for `none_in_coverage`. The plan's `outlook`, `windows`, `presentation`, and coverage attributes are available through Home Assistant's entity state inspection.

In the integration options, set **Display horizon**, **Reference horizon**, and **Display interval** to control the published outlook. Presentation options set the level label/colors, expose window or cost entities, and choose cost precision. The card editor can choose entity display names, icons, and timestamp format. A 24-hour horizon means 24 elapsed hours from the snapshot; its local clock range can span 23 or 25 wall-clock hours around daylight-saving transitions.

For a denser tablet display, add the optional native [Markdown card example](../examples/dashboard.yaml) in a dashboard code editor and replace its placeholder entity IDs. That example renders current level, the next different level/time, all three upcoming start/end pairs, and coverage warnings. It includes the local timezone abbreviation so repeated daylight-saving hours remain distinct. The visual card setup above requires no YAML or custom card. Preview at the tablet's actual viewport and check that rendered timestamps match the selected Home Assistant timezone. With synthetic data, check that a near BOOST and a later LIMIT both appear before either starts, then check absent windows, missing tomorrow, and stale inputs. Do not install an example on a live kiosk merely to perform this preview.

### Optional ApexCharts timeline

If [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) is already installed, its `data_generator` can turn `plan.outlook` into a time-based curve. This card is optional and is not required by Energy Compass. In the recipe below, replace the plan entity with the one selected in your installation. The data generator reads each interval's actual timestamp, so it does not assume that a local day has exactly 24 clock hours.

```yaml
type: custom:apexcharts-card
graph_span: 24h
span:
  start: minute
series:
  - entity: sensor.replace_with_plan
    name: Extra kWh cost
    type: column
    data_generator: |
      const rows = entity.attributes.outlook || [];
      return rows.filter((row) => row.cost_per_kwh !== null).map((row) => [new Date(row.start).getTime(), row.cost_per_kwh]);
```

The timeline shows forecast-dependent incremental cost, not measured savings. The cost assumes the optimizer's proposed plan; actual consumption savings can differ until a controller follows it.

## Dashboard examples

Ready-made sections live in [`examples/dashboards/`](../examples/dashboards/). Paste one into a Sections view with **Edit dashboard → ⋮ → Raw configuration editor** and replace the `replace_with_…` entity IDs with your own:

- [`deye_controller.yaml`](../examples/dashboards/deye_controller.yaml) — Deye controller mode, runtime code and reason; native cards only, fixed entity IDs from the [controller package](#deye-inverter-controller).
- [`plan_chart.yaml`](../examples/dashboards/plan_chart.yaml) — 12 h of measured load, grid, PV and SoC with the next 24 h of the plan, dashed, over plan-state background bands. Set the battery capacity in the SoC generator to your Energy Compass capacity.
- [`consumer_compass_chart.yaml`](../examples/dashboards/consumer_compass_chart.yaml) — Consumer Compass levels, 4 h history and 20 h forecast.

The two charts need [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) 2.2.3 or later. The files are generated by `tools/dashboards/build.py`; instead of editing placeholders, you can print a section with your entities, capacity and language, for example `python tools/dashboards/build.py --print plan --lang pl --capacity 25 --entity plan=sensor.my_plan --entity valid=binary_sensor.my_forecast_valid --entity soc=sensor.my_battery_soc --entity load=sensor.my_load_power --entity grid=sensor.my_grid_power --entity pv=sensor.my_pv_power`.

## Opt-in notifications

First open Energy Compass integration options and turn on **Notify enabled** in **Notifications**. This is the master opt-in: when it is off, the blueprint sends nothing, even if its override option is on. The integration options also set enabled events, minimum favorable duration, LIMIT lead time, quiet hours, cooldown, and daily cap. Defaults are 2 hours, 30 minutes, 22:00–08:00, 60 minutes, and 3 per local day.

Copy [the blueprint](../blueprints/automation/energy_compass/notifications.yaml) into Home Assistant's `config/blueprints/automation/energy_compass/notifications.yaml`, then go to **Settings → Automations & scenes → Blueprints → Create automation**. Select **Energy Compass window notifications**. In the blueprint form, select the compass, plan, forecast-valid, and three window entities from the same integration instance. By default, the automation uses the current resolved notification preferences from that plan, including later integration-option changes. Turn on **Override integration notification settings** only when this automation needs its own events, timing, quiet hours, cooldown, or cap; the selectors below that toggle then take precedence. **Notify enabled** in the integration still controls both modes. If plan preferences are missing or incomplete, the automation waits for a valid plan instead of sending.

Choose at least one **Notification action** in the blueprint's action selector; that sequence is the only action the automation runs. An empty action sequence sends nothing and does not use a window identity or daily allowance. The integration form offers the two events this version handles: **favorable** and **LIMIT**. Existing saved action or other event preferences remain readable but are not dispatched by this blueprint.

Before creating the automation, use **Settings → Devices & services → Helpers → Create helper** to create two **Text** helpers for the last favorable and LIMIT window starts, one **Number** helper for the daily count (minimum 0, maximum at least your daily cap, step 1), one **Date and/or time** helper with **date only** for the last local date, and one **Date and/or time** helper with **both date and time** for the last send. Select all five in the blueprint form. Each text helper stores one integer Unix timestamp, shorter than 20 characters; a maximum length of at least 20 characters is sufficient, and the default 100 is safe. Leave their initial values empty so Home Assistant restores their last values after restart. Do not share the helpers between multiple automations.

The blueprint examines current favorable windows and upcoming LIMIT windows on forecast changes and each minute. A favorable window must last at least the selected duration; LIMIT fires within the selected lead time. The last window start, local date, count, and send time persist through the helpers. A recalculation that shifts a start by less than 30 minutes is treated as the same window; a larger reschedule may notify again, subject to cooldown and cap. Empty first-use text/date/time values are accepted while the count is zero. An unknown count, an unknown date/time after the first action, or any unavailable helper suppresses actions until the helpers recover. During testing, choose an **Event** action with a local event name and inspect the automation trace; do not choose a real notify action until the behavior suits your household.

## Import the strategy switch blueprint

Requires three dedicated helpers, created the same way as the notification blueprint's: **Settings →
Devices & services → Helpers → Create helper** — one **Date and/or time** helper with **date and
time** (`last_run`), one **Text** helper with a max length of at least 24, long enough for
`manual:self_sufficiency` (`manual_marker`), and one **Text** helper with a max length of at least 20
(`pending_marker`), which records the strategy the automation is about to apply so a restart
mid-write can be reconciled. Leave their initial values empty.

Copy [the blueprint](../blueprints/automation/energy_compass/strategy_switch.yaml) into Home
Assistant's `config/blueprints/automation/energy_compass/strategy_switch.yaml`, then go to
**Settings → Automations & scenes → Blueprints → Create automation** and select **Energy Compass
strategy switch**. Select the `select.<name>_strategy` entity, the plan and forecast-valid entities,
a PV-forecast-for-tomorrow entity (for example a Solcast "forecast tomorrow" sensor), your typical
daily household load, the RCE PSE next-day price sensor and its `prices`/`rce_pln`/`dtime`
attribute names, and the three helpers above. **Enabled rules** defaults to all three opt-in rules
(`alert`, `pv_swap`, `self_sufficiency`); `cost_min` is the unconditional fallback and is never
listed there. An **Alert entity** is optional — leave it empty to skip that rule entirely.

The automation runs once daily at 14:05 (after RCE next-day prices and the Solcast update normally
publish), retries hourly until 20:00 if next-day prices are still unavailable, and reconciles a
partially-applied write on Home Assistant start. A manual change to the strategy select is detected
and blocks the economic rules until the next successful scheduled run; the alert rule and the daily
scheduled run are never blocked by it. See [the full rule and price contract](model.md#dispatch-strategies).

## Deye inverter controller

The optional controller executes the plan on a Deye hybrid inverter through the [Solarman integration](https://github.com/davidrapan/ha-solarman). Read [how it behaves](guide.en.md#deye-inverter-controller-solarman) first; it writes battery currents and TOU programs.

1. **Package.** Copy [`packages/energy_compass_deye.yaml`](../packages/energy_compass_deye.yaml) to `config/packages/` and enable packages in `configuration.yaml` (`homeassistant: packages: !include_dir_named packages`). It creates the mode select, session helpers and the plan, runtime and timing sensors. It reads the TOU program entities with the default prefix `inverter_deye_program_`; if your Solarman entities are named differently, print a package with your prefix: `python tools/deye_controller/build.py --prefix my_inverter_program_ > energy_compass_deye.yaml`. Run `ha core check` and restart.
2. **Blueprint.** [Import it](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmarino39%2Fha-energy-compass%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fenergy_compass%2Fdeye_solarman_controller.yaml) or copy [`deye_solarman_controller.yaml`](../blueprints/automation/energy_compass/deye_solarman_controller.yaml) into `config/blueprints/automation/energy_compass/`, then **Settings → Automations & scenes → Blueprints → Energy Compass Deye (Solarman) controller → Create automation**. Select the Energy Compass entities of one installation, the Solarman device and the battery entities. Under **Limits and takeover**, set capacity, power and current limits to your hardware, and list every other automation that writes the same registers in **Previous battery automations**.
3. **Simulation first.** Set `input_select.energy_compass_deye_mode` to **Simulation**. Inspect `sensor.energy_compass_deye_runtime` → `runtime` (state, reason, `desired`) against the plan over at least a day. Nothing is written in Simulation.
4. **Auto.** Turn off the previous battery automations, then choose **Auto**. Watch the first writes; **Off** restores the base profile and releases control.

Only one controller automation may exist per inverter. The blueprint and package are generated by `tools/deye_controller/build.py`; changes go into the generator.
