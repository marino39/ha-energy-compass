# custom_components/energy_compass/balance_tracker.py
"""Periodic LFP balance bookkeeping: pure state, no Home Assistant imports.

A balance counts once SOC stays at or above the threshold for the whole hold.
Only observed time counts: readings further apart than the SOC max age break
the hold, and a hold whose latest full reading went stale neither holds nor
completes. Completion is evaluated lazily while the hold is fresh, so an
unchanged full SOC completes the hold without needing another state event.
